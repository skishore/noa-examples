# ent-comp

A light, *fast* entity-component system in JS with no dependencies.

## Overview

An [Entity Component System](http://vasir.net/blog/game-development/how-to-build-entity-component-system-in-javascript) 
(ECS) is a programming construct that solves a very common 
problem in gamedev. It lets you easily model dynamic systems 
where the entities are difficult to describe with OO-style inheritance.

This library is the distilled result of my playing with a bunch of ECS libraries,
removing what wasn't useful, and rejiggering what remained to perform well in the 
most important cases. Specifically it's tuned to be fast at accessing the state 
of a given entity/component, and looping over all states for a given component. 

To get started, check the usage examples below, or the [API reference](api.md).

## Installation:

To use as a dependency:

	npm install ent-comp

To hack on it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andyhall/ent-comp.git
cd ent-comp
npm install
npm test         # run tests
npm run bench    # run benchmarks
npm run doc      # rebuild API docs
```

## API reference:

See [api.md](api.md).


## Basic usage:

Create the ECS, entities, and components thusly:

```js
var EntComp = require('ent-comp')
var ecs = new EntComp()

// Entities are simply integer IDs:
var playerID = ecs.createEntity() // 1
var monsterID = ecs.createEntity() // 2

// components are defined with a definition object:
ecs.createComponent({
	name: 'isPlayer'
})

// component definitions can be accessed by name
ecs.components['isPlayer']  // returns the definition object
```

Once you have some entities and components, you can add them, remove them, and check their existence:

```js
ecs.addComponent(playerID, 'isPlayer')
ecs.hasComponent(playerID, 'isPlayer') // true

ecs.removeComponent(playerID, 'isPlayer')
ecs.hasComponent(playerID, 'isPlayer') // false

// when creating an entity you can pass in an array of components to add
var id = ecs.createEntity([ 'isPlayer', 'other-component' ]) 
```

The trivial example above implements a stateless component, which can be used like a boolean flag for entities. But most real components will also need to manage some data for each entity. This is done by giving the component a `state` object, and using the `#getState` method. 

```js
// createComponent returns the component name, for convenience
var locationComp = ecs.createComponent({
	name: 'location',
	state: { x:0, y:0, z:0 },
})

// give the player entity a location component
ecs.addComponent(playerID, locationComp)

// grab its state to update its data
var loc = ecs.getState(playerID, locationComp)
loc.y = 37

// you can also pass in initial state values when adding a component:
ecs.addComponent(monsterID, locationComp, { y: 42 })
ecs.getState(monsterID, locationComp) // { x:0, y:42, z:0 }
```

When a component is added to an entity, its state object is automatically 
populated with an `__id` property denoting the entity's ID. 

```js
loc.__id // same as playerID
```

Components can also have `onAdd` and `onRemove` properties, which get called 
as any entity gains or loses the component. 

```js
ecs.createComponent({
	name: 'orientation',
	state: { angle:0 },
	onAdd: (id, state) => {
		// initialize to a random direction
		state.angle = 360 * Math.random()
	},
	onRemove: (id, state) => {
		console.log('orientation removed from entity', id)
	}
})
```

Finally, components can define `system` and/or `renderSystem` functions. 
When your game ticks or renders, call the appropriate library methods, 
and each component system function will get passed a list of state objects
for all the entities that have that component.

Components can also define an `order` property (default `99`), to specify the order in which systems fire (lowest to highest).

```js
ecs.createComponent({
	name: 'hitPoints',
	state: { hp: 100 },
	order: 10,
	system: function(dt, states) {
		// states is an array of entity state objects
		states.forEach(state => {
			if (state.hp <= 0) console.log('Dead entity!', state.__id)
		})
	},
	renderSystem: function(dt, states) {
		states.forEach(state => {
			var id = state.__id
			var hp = state.hp
			drawTheEntityHitpoints(id, hp) 
		})
	},
})

// calling tick/render triggers the systems
ecs.tick( tick_time )
ecs.render( render_time )
```

See the [API reference](api.md) for details on each method.

## Multi-components

This library now supports multi components, where a component can be added to the same entity multiple times. Each addition creates a separate state object.

API may change someday, but for now all ECS methods that normally 
return a state object instead return an array of state objects. 
Calling `removeComponent` will remove all multi-component instances for 
that entity, and there's a new `removeMultiComponent(id, name, index)` 
API to remove them individually (by their index in the array).

In practice it looks like this:
```js
ecs.createComponent({
	name: 'buff',
	multi: true, // this marks the component as multi
	state: { buffName: '', duration: 100 },
	system: function(dt, stateLists) {
		// stateLists is the array of all ent/comp pairs
		stateLists.forEach(statesArr => {
			// statesArr is an array of multi components for this entity
			statesArr.forEach((state, i) => {
				// update the state of this particular entity's buff
				state.duration -= dt
				if (state.duration < 0) {
					ecs.removeMultiComponent(state.__id, 'buff', i)
				}
			})
		})
	},
})
```

## Further usage:

If you need to query certain components many times each frame, you can create 
bound accessor functions to get the existence or state of a given component.
These accessors are moderately faster than `getState` and `hasComponent`.

```js
var hasLocation = ecs.getComponentAccessor('location')
hasLocation(entityID) // true or false

var getLocation = ecs.getStateAccessor('location')
getLocation(entityID) // returns a state object
```

There's also an API for getting an array of all state objects for a given component.

```js
var states = ecs.getStatesList('hitPoints')
// returns the same array that gets passed to `system` functions
```

## Caveat about complex state objects:

When you add a component to an entity, a new state object is created for that ent/comp pair. This new state object is a **shallow copy** of the component's default state, not a duplicate or deep clone. This means any non-primitive state properties will be copied by reference.

What this means to you is, state objects containing nested objects or arrays 
probably won't do what you intended. For example:

```js
ecs.createComponent({
	name: 'foo',
	state: {
		vector3: [0,0,0]
	}
})
```

If you define a component that way, all its state objects will contain references to *the same array*. You probably want each to have its own, which you can do by initializing them in the `onAdd` handler:

```js
ecs.createComponent({
	name: 'foo',
	state: {
		vector3: null
	},
	onAdd: function(id, state) {
		if (!state.vector3) state.vector3 = [0,0,0]
	}
})
```

Testing for the value before overwriting means that you can pass in an initial
value when adding the component, and it will still do what you expect:

```js
ecs.addComponent(id, 'foo', { vector3: [1,1,1] })
```

## Things this library doesn't do:

 1. Assemblages. I can't for the life of me see how they add any value. 
 If I'm missing something please file an issue.
 
 2. Provide any way of querying which entities have components A and B, but not C, and so on. If you need this, I think maintaining your own lists will be faster 
 (and probably easier to use) than anything the library could do automatically.
